<p>I am a full time designer, part-time writer, and occasional dreamer. With an interest in the fantastical, I am specializing now in creative based content such as blogging and novel writing</p>
<p>This is a personal web site for my writing and photography, each with its own creative outlet in the fantastical. Most of what I do springs from the imagination with more focus on creating a collaborative story telling adventure with readers who want to see how it will all come together.</p>
