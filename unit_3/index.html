<p>I am a full time designer, part-time writer, and occasional dreamer. With an interest in the fantastical, I am specializing now in creative based content such as blogging and novel writing</p>
<p>This is a personal web site for my writing and photography, each with its own creative outlet in the fantastical. Most of what I do springs from the imagination with more focus on creating a collaborative story telling adventure with readers who want to see how it will all come together.</p>

Think riding a bike was hard? Try jumping headfirst into a 350k novel and having to pare it down to a paltry 80k! Ah, nothing like it. Seriously. Give it a try one day and if you come back with your sanity intact I will be highly impressed.
<p>
In addition to writing novels, I work as a graphic designer and make my way through the trials and joys of photography. Please visit these portfolio pages to see more!
